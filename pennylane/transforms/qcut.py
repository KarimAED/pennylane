    This operation is differentiable. The ``prepare_nodes`` and ``measure_nodes`` arguments are both
    sequences of size ``len(communication_graph.nodes)`` that describe the order of indices in the
    ``tensors`` with respect to to the :class:`~.PrepareNode` and :class`~.MeasureNode` edges in the

    .. note::

        This function is designed for use as part of the circuit cutting workflow. Check out the

            the tensors

    Returns:

    .. code-block:: python

        graph = nx.MultiDiGraph([(0, 1, {"pair": (meas[0][0], prep[1][0])})])

    The network can then be contracted using:
